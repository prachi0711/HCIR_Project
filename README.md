# HCIR Project

This project aims to build a career advisor robot using a simulated Pepper robot in Qibullet, powered by a Rasa-based conversational agent. The robot will interact with users through dialogue and provide career suggestions using bayesian network model based on their preferences.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following:

- **Python 3.8+** installed
- **Rasa** for the conversational agent

### Install Python

You can download Python 3.8 from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```
python -m venv .venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:

Linux/macOS:
    source .venv/bin/activate

Windows:

    .\.venv\Scripts\activate

### Install Rasa

Rasa is used to manage the conversational flow and provide career suggestions. To set it up:

    pip install rasa

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:prachi0711/HCIR_Project.git

cd HCIR_PROJECT
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install necessary libraries like requests, pyttsx3, and others.

### 3. Set Up Rasa

Navigate to the rasa_agent directory and train the model:

    cd rasa_agent
    rasa train

## Running the Project

The custom actions are defined in the actions.py file. To run the action server, use the following command:

    rasa run actions

Start the Rasa server to enable the robot to communicate with Rasa:

    rasa run --enable-api --cors "*"

The server will be accessible at http://localhost:5005.

Run the pepper simulation script


    python behaviour_script.py

This will launch the Qibullet simulation, start the Pepper robot, and enable the conversation to begin.


Continuous Dialogue: The conversation can continue with the user providing input, and Rasa will process and generate appropriate responses.

Text-to-Speech: The robot uses pyttsx3 for speech synthesis to convert Rasa response to speech.

Gestures: Predefined gestures (such as waving) accompany the robotâ€™s speech.
